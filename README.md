 An Effective Pricing Framework for Noisy Graph Statistics

To justify the performance of our pricing method, we compare it with the state-of-art methods:

	(1) $\textsf{Baseline}$, a noisy pricing framework for quantifying information by using global sensitivity for the subgraph counting.
 
	(2) $\textsf{2nd Order}$, an information contribution quantification framework by giving the second-order local sensitivity with a simple upper bound for $k$-clique counting.
 
	We implemented the proposed algorithms:
 \textsf{Degree}, \textsf{LS'}$k$-star and \textsf{Two-phase}
	for calculating the information contribution and answers of node degrees, $k$-stars and $k$-cliques respectively.
